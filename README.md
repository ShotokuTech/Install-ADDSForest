# Install-ADDSForest
Server 2022 Active Directory Install-ADDSForest PowerShell.
In my previous video I showed how to customize a Server 2022 image for Hyper-V using SYSPREP with unattend. In this video I use the Install-ADDSForest PowerShell command to build the first ADDS Domain Controller in a new forest. Hey, how many times have you done this in production?
